    <h3 id="Mercury">A. Mercury</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="limage" src="images\Mercury.png" alt="Mercury image"><b>Mercury</b> is
        the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth
        days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of
        commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes.
        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from
        the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near
        the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it
        may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the
        planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over
        its synodic period of approximately 116 days.<br><br>Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar
        System. it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen
        from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every
        two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian
        years.<br><br>Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its
        orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance
        from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily
        cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for
        billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally
        more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427
        °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C;
        −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Venus">B. Venus</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="Rimage" src="images\Venus.png" alt="Venus image"><b>Venus</b> is the
        second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural
        object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the
        naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun,
        either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the
        Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243
        Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar
        System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets
        in the east. Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the
        Solar System.<br><br>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of
        their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in
        other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96%
        carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of
        Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the
        Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C;
        867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its
        surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these will
        have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably
        photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of
        the lack of a planetary magnetic field.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Earth">C. Earth</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="limage" src="images\Earth.png" alt="Earth image"><b>Earth</b>
        is the
        third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of
        Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly
        by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which
        together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is
        divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while
        its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic
        field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.<br><br>Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of
        nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed
        by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface
        temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to
        moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves,
        occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.<br><br>Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space,
        especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days.
        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The
        gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis,
        and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most
        massive of the four rocky planets.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Mars">D. Mars</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="Rimage" src="images\Mars.png" alt="Mars image"><b>Mars</b>
        is the fourth
        planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In
        English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter
        refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
        atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and
        polar ice caps of Earth.<br><br>The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational
        period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site
        of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles
        Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere
        covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are
        small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars
        trojan.<br><br>There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of
        extant life. Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover.
        Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the
        atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear
        to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient
        to cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft). In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large
        amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be
        equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.</p>

    <h3 id="Jupiter">E. Jupiter</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="limage" src="images\Jupiter.png" alt="Jupiter image"><b>Mars</b> is the
        fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a
        half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the
        mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and
        Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the
        gods, because of its observed size.<br><br>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one
        quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the
        other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior
        generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape
        is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is
        visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting
        boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since
        at least the 17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.<br><br>Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to
        visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored on a
        number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to
        1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the
        New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to
        Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. Future targets for
        exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of the moon Europa.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Saturn">F. Saturn</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="Rimage" src="images\Saturn.png" alt="Saturn image"><b>Saturn</b> is the
        sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an
        average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of
        Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman
        god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. The Romans named the
        seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the planet
        Saturn.<br><br>Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
        compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid
        hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia
        crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give
        rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580
        times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of
        Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can
        appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high
        as on Neptune.<br><br>The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of
        ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of
        which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's
        largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less
        massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Uranus">G. Uranus</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="limage" src="images\Uranus.png" alt="Uranus image"><b>Uranus</b> is the
        seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to
        Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus
        (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
        Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of
        the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice
        giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and
        Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia,
        and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar
        System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with
        water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is
        mainly composed of ices and rock.<br><br>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a
        magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is
        tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most
        other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet
        in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains
        the only spacecraft to visit the planet. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased
        weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900
        km/h; 560 mph).</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Neptune">H. Neptune</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="Rimage" src="images\Neptune.png" alt="Neptune image"><b>Neptune</b> is
        the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
        diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth,
        slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because
        its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every
        164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god
        of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek
        letter psi.<br><br>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
        mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope
        on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon,
        Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located
        telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size,
        making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by
        the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the Hubble
        Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional
        detailed observations from afar.<br><br>Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of
        hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher
        proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily
        composed of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this
        distinction. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance, though
        an unknown component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to Uranus.</p>

    <h3 id="Pluto">I. Pluto</h3>
    <br>
    <p><img class="limage" src="images\Pluto.png" alt="Pluto image"><b>Pluto</b> is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a
        ring of bodies beyond the
        orbit of
        Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. After Pluto was discovered in
        1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was
        questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc,
        including the dwarf planet Eris. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define
        the term "planet"—excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.<br><br>Pluto is the ninth-largest and
        tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by
        volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock
        and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric
        and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the
        Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance
        with Neptune prevents them from colliding. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average
        distance (39.5 AU).<br><br>Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that
        of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the
        barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.<br>The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of
        Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first and, to date, only spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, New
        Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers
        announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules
        that may be ingredients for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and other gases released
        from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.</p>
