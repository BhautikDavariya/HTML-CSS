								<strong>Why Node.js?</strong>
							</p>
							<P>A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.
							</P>
							<p>Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Sends the task to the computer’s file system.</li>
								<li>Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.</li>
								<li>Returns the content to the client.</li>
								<li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Here is how Node.js handles a file request:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Sends the task to the computer’s file system.</li>
								<li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
								<li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.</p>
							<p>Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>What Can Node.js Do?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Node.js can generate dynamic page content</li>
								<li>Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server</li>
								<li>Node.js can collect form data</li>
								<li>Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database</li>

						<h4 >What is ASP.NET MVC?
						</h4>
						<p><strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>is an open-source software from Microsoft. Its web development framework combines
							the features of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the most up-to-date ideas and techniques from
						Agile development and the best parts of the existing ASP.NET platform.</p>
						<p>The MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an application development pattern or design pattern which separates an
						application into three main components:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Model</li>
							<li>View</li>
							<li>Controller</li>
						</ol>
						<p><b>Model:</b> Model: Model is a part of the application which implements the logic for the data domain of the
							application. It is used to retrieve and store model state in a database such as SQL Server database. It also
						used for business logic separation from the data in the application.</p>
						<p><b>View:</b> View is a component that forms the application’s user interface. It is uses to create web pages
							for the application. An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes,
						drop-down lists and check boxes based on the current state of a Product object.</p>
						<p><b>Controller:</b> Controller is the component which handles user interaction. It works with the model and
							selects the view to render the web page. In an MVC application, the view only displays information whereas
						the controller handles and responds to the user input and requests.</p>

						<h4>What is Flutter exactly?
						</h4>
						<p><b>Flutter</b> is an open source framework to create high quality, high performance mobile applications
							across mobile operating systems – Android and iOS. It provides a simple, powerful, efficient and easy to
						understand SDK to write mobile application in Google’s own language, Dart.</p>
						<p><b>Dart</b> is Flutter’s object-oriented language that uses Ahead-of-Time compilation techniques and compiles
						into native code without that additional bridge. This noticeably speeds up the app startup time.</p>
						<p><b>Features:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fast Development</li>
							<li>Expressive and Flexible UI</li>
							<li>Native Performance</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Flutter follows the reactive development architecture, but with a twist. The main thing to know about
							reactive programming is that it updates UI contents automatically when you update the variables in the code.

						<p><b>React Native</b> lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React,
							letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don’t build a
							mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that’s indistinguishable from an
							app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular
						iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.</p>
						<p><b>React Native Features</b></p>
						<p>Following are the features of React Native −</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>React</b>− This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript.</li>
							<li><b>Native </b>− You can use native components controlled by JavaScript.</li>

						<ul>
							<li><b>JavaScript </b>− You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps.</li>

						<h4>What is Web Designing?</h4>
						<p>Visual + Interaction = Web Design Core</p>
						<p><b>Web designing</b> is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today,
							designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall functionality. Web design also
						includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.</p>
						<p>Web design is quite complex and daunting, but with the development of Internet and technology, web design
							overflow than ever before nowadays. Hence, becoming a web designer has become the main trend among young
						designers.</p>
						<p>Many young designers often misunderstand the concept of web design, web design is about design, not about
							coding and front-end development. Of course, it would be great if you know some coding language (HTML, CSS,
							JavaScript), but you can’t get yourself deep into front-end development, that’s not the core of web design.
						Web design is to solve the communication problems between users and web page information.</p>
						<p><b>Key Points</b></p>
						<p>Design Plan should include the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Details about information architecture.</li>
							<li>Planned structure of site.</li>
							<li>A site map of pages</li>

					<div class="pgf">
						<p><b>ReactJS</b> is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official
						documentation, following is the definition −</p>
						<p>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI
							components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React
							abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also
							render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way
							reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data
						binding.</p>
						<h4>Why we use ReactJS?</h4>
						<p>The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses
							virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is
							faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other
							frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.
						</p>
						<p><b>React Advantages</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript
							virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.</li>
							<li>Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.</li>
							<li>Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.</li>
